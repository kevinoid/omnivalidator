* Sandbox HTTP connections to validators to avoid leaking information or
  polluting user state/cookies <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Creating_Sandboxed_HTTP_Connections>
* Filtering and searching of messages in the console
* More work on propagating configuration changes around without restarting
    * Reload the validator list in the main menus
    * Make sure the validator objects are not held outside of the vregistry

Things to Test:
* Test validation of non-cacheable pages works correctly
    * HTTPS and Cache-Control: no-cache
* Test that slow validator responses and fast tab/page change doesn't result in showing results that are not applicable to the current page
* Test validation of non-text content
* Test automatic validation of pages which contain frames which are slow to load (make sure validation starts before frame finishes loading).

When dropping support for Firefox 3.6:
* Remove JSON imports
* Remove underscore.keys, underscore.isEmpty in favor of ES5 native methods
* Freeze objects returned from validatorregistry (and possibly others)
* Remove addonutils and use AddonManager directly
* Remove hard-coding of aboutURL and homepageURL outside of install.rdf
