* Sandbox HTTP connections to validators to avoid leaking information or
  polluting user state/cookies <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Creating_Sandboxed_HTTP_Connections>
* Filtering and searching of messages in the console
* Support re-running a validator without reloading a page
    * Depends on being able to selectively clear messages&status by vid
* Improve code for fetching page from cache (using cache tokens or whatnot)
  to match View Source and Save As once bug 136633 is fixed (if ever).
* Remove as much of the duplication as possible between ValidatorNu and
  W3CValidator.
* Document how to implement Validator.  This is the most likely extension point
  for contributions and should be a top priority for documentation.
* Share resource stream between validators (especially to avoid multiple POSTs)

Things to test with a testing framework:
* Test validation of non-cacheable pages works correctly
    * HTTPS and Cache-Control: no-cache
* Test that slow validator responses and fast tab/page change doesn't result in showing results that are not applicable to the current page (may be unavoidable)
* Test validation of non-HTML/XML and non-text content
* Test automatic validation of pages which contain frames which are slow to load (make sure validation starts before frame finishes loading).
* Test with the following preferences
    browser.cache.disk.enable false
    browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl false with HTTPS pages
    browser.cache.memory.enable false
    network.http.use-cache false

When dropping support for Firefox 3.6:
* Remove JSON imports
* Remove underscore.keys, underscore.isEmpty in favor of ES5 native methods
* Freeze objects returned from validatorregistry (and possibly others)
* Remove addonutils and use AddonManager directly
* Remove hard-coding of aboutURL and homepageURL outside of install.rdf
* Switch icons to SVG versions
