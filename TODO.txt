* Sandbox HTTP connections to validators to avoid leaking information or
  polluting user state/cookies <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Creating_Sandboxed_HTTP_Connections>
* Filtering and searching of messages in the console

Things to Test:
* Test validation of non-cacheable pages works correctly
    * HTTPS and Cache-Control: no-cache
* Test that slow validator responses and fast tab/page change doesn't result in showing results that are not applicable to the current page
* Test validation of non-text content
* Test automatic validation of pages which contain frames which are slow to load (make sure validation starts before frame finishes loading).

When dropping support for Firefox 3.6:
* Remove JSON imports
* Remove objutils.getOwnPropertyNames, objutils.hasOwnProperties
* Freeze objects returned from validatorregistry (and possibly others)
